        <ol>
            <li>Im a on and off worker so this took me a while to actually get a hold on what I was doing. I usually work with my tutor for alot of this work but as I have already been shown most of the things In this assignment before I did It mostly on my own this time. In total Id say It took about 15 hours but 5 of those I spent stuck as I made a mistake and could not find the solution till hours later.</li>
            <br/>
            <li>I got help from my tutor In starting up this assignment. I used chat-gpt to help me validate some text and help with my small easy questions. There was also some githubs I looked at during he start for some Insperation.</li>
            <br/>
            <li>I asked my tutor Bradley Ayers and a classmate who ges by Alec B In the same class as me.</li>
            <br/>
            <li>I only asked one question and It was asnwered very quickly [TY Norman]</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Im pretty confident that I could figure out another assignment like this. It was pretty easy just took me a while to remember everything so I asked alot of questions. Id say 4/10 on diffulculty but 6/10 for how many times I got stuck.</li>
