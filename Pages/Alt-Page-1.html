        evolution over the decades, becoming one of the most popular pickup
        trucks globally. Initially marketed as a compact truck, the Hilux gained
        traction in various markets, especially in Australia and Asia, where it

        preferences, incorporating advanced technologies and features while
        maintaining its core identity. The truck has achieved impressive
        cumulative sales, surpassing 17 million units by 2017, reflecting its
