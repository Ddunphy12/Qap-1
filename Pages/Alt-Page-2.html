        The 2020 facelift of the Toyota Hilux introduced a series of significant
        updates aimed at enhancing both aesthetics and performance. Externally,
        the truck received a refreshed look with new LED headlamps, tail-lamps,
        and redesigned 18-inch alloy wheels, giving it a more modern and
        aggressive appearance. Inside, drivers are greeted with a revamped
        instrument cluster and a 4.2-inch multi-info display for better
        usability. Performance-wise, the 2.8-liter diesel engine was upgraded to
        deliver 204 PS and 500 Nm of torque, while the 2.4-liter engine
        benefited from improved fuel injection technology for enhanced
        efficiency. Additionally, the suspension system saw revisions for
        improved ride comfort, with new dampers and updated leaf spring
        bushings, ensuring a smoother experience both on and off the road.
        Enhanced safety features, including Toyota Safety Sense in select
        markets, further position the 2020 Hilux as a well-rounded choice for
        modern drivers.
